# Instructions

See @README.md

## General

- Write simple, minimal, modular code that is strongly typed and:
- Use short variable names in clean, tight, well-organized stanzas
- Don't add comments unless critical; code should be self-descriptive
- Prefer pure functions with explicit inputs and outputs
- Prefer early return over conditional
- Array properties should default to empty arrays, not `null`
- Prefer libraries' own types over writing your own
- Don't create classes (unless instructed)
- Don't add console.logs - unless temporarily for debugging
- Never include backward compat code (unless instructed)
- When researching APIs and docs, use latest content (it is 2026)
- Make shared constants `UPPER_CASE`
- For functions, prefer camel case verbs (`calcTimeAt(x)`, not `timeAt(x)`)
