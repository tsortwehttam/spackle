# Spackle

Spackle is a macOS menu bar app for inline AI rewrites.

Highlight text in any app, hit a shortcut (⌘⌥⌃I by default), and your selected text is replaced in place.

## How It Works

1. Select text in Mail, Notes, Slack, browser text areas, editors, etc.
2. Press the shortcut.
3. Spackle sends the selected text to your configured model.
4. Spackle replaces the selection.

An optional trigger mode also exists if you prefer typed or spoken delimiters.

## Setup

- Bring your own API key (stored in Keychain).
- Choose a provider: OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- Grant Accessibility permission (required).

## Privacy

Only text needed for the active rewrite request is sent to your configured provider.
